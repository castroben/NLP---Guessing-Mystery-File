# NLP - guessing the language of a "mystery" file

This repository contains a python script "nlp" which performs natural language processing on a set of files inside the "ngrams" directory to determine the language of "mystery" file.
In essence, the script builds a dictionary of 3-character ngrams and their frequencies for each known-language file, and compares each dictionary to the dictionary of the "mystery" file.
